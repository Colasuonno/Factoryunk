- Factory idea  -

You can place these factories in your faction land, you use the blueprints to place them, 
then you can upgrade them and maintain them. Simple.

Now for advanced details:

We will have various different types of factories that you can place.
 These factories will either generate items that can be sold for currency or will generate currency 
 (not sure exactly how this will work. We need to figure out what exactly they 
 will generate. They will also have a small (.05%) chance of finding 1 (soft currency name). 

however, to get a blueprint you have to either buy them with soft currency, in-game 
money (significantly more) or you can get them in crates. Some will be only premium ones. 
Factories will have upgrade routes, you can upgrade how much it stores before it needs to
 be emptied, you can upgrade how fast it generates you will also be able to purchase multipliers 
 for a certain amount of time for your factions factories.

- Maintenance
These factories have to be maintained, they have health if they aren’t kept maintained 
(players can pay for a mechanic visit, which would just be paying the server
 and based on the health the server would charge an amount relative to the health.
  So maybe it would charge $123 for the health to be increased from 38% to 100% while it would cost
   $190 for it to go from 10% to 100%, not exact math) then they will break, if it breaks down it 
   will change to a broken down state, then it would have to be rebuilt which costs significantly more 
   than if you just have it kept maintained as it goes down, this is another reason to stay active. However, 
   regardless of the price to repair, it will cost a lot less to repair than it would generate during its running 
   period. So for a repair, it would cost $2,000 but it may generate $20,000 during its running period.
However, if it breaks down there is a downside, it can be destroyed when being raided...


If your faction is raided, the faction who is raiding can destroy the factory if the factory is “broken down” and then take the factory blueprint (will be automatically reset to level 1) this is a reason to stay logged on, however, you can purchase “Factory Workers”

- factory workers
This would cost soft currency and it would be similar to a chunkanchor, it would just keep it maintained, and the factory worker (an NPC would sit there and walk in circles around the factory) would keep the factory maintained and would also collect the resources and then when you come back online, the factory worker will have everything that he earned stored on him, you can then access his storage when you find the factory.

Basically, if you have a factory worker, your factory is safe, it can’t be raided because it’s kept maintained and it will also keep things stored on him. 

- If raided
If the base is raided, the factory can only be touched by a non-faction member if it’s broken down, if it’s running, it can’t be touched. If a player walks into the factory area, they will be pushed back away from it and it will say this “FACTORY > Factory is maintained! Force field active!” 

Then if it’s broken down, you will go to the center of it where there will be a hologram that says “status: broken down” then the player will click the item in the center of the factory that generally would open the GUI for generated items and available upgrades, but instead of seeing that they will see “collect factory” then if they are level 25+ or have a rank they can collect the factory blueprint. 

If you have a factory on faction land, and the faction is disbanded, (land is no longer  claimed) the factory will be stored in “/factory menu” where they can open a GUI and see all of their blueprints (NOTE: these factories will maintain the last level they were at before dismantled, while if they are destroyed by another faction when broken down, they are reset to level 1 and do not maintain their last level)

There will be 3 tiers of factories

Common factories:
(Names subject to change)
Coal
Iron

Rare factories:
Gold
Lapis
Red stone

Legendary
Emerald
Diamond


And each type of factory blueprint can be found in their respective crate or purchased with in-game currency OR soft currency.




RULES:

Factories must be placed on faction claimed land

A player can only buy 5 factories a day but they can win more in crates, so if you want more than 5, then you could buy crate keys and win them there.




What’s the point of buying a factory?
- passive income
Are they pay to win?
- no, because they are obtainable by any faction with in-game currency.
What about when the season is over?
- factories are turned into blueprints so long as they are MAINTAINED AT THE TIME OF THE SERVER CLOSING. So they can be used in the next season
What do the factories get you?
- money


Ideas:
Have a small chance of hitting a jackpot, which means the server would basically run through a bunch of possible jackpot rewards, then it will choose one, maybe a crate key, maybe some of our soft currency (very little) maybe it’ll give you extra money, the only problem is where would this money go? Maybe each factory has an owner (person who places it) then that owner can add factory admins (through GUI in each factory) who can claim the rewards which are kept in that GUI.

If a player who doesn’t have access to the factory tries to open the GUI (even if they are in the same faction as the owner, if they aren’t specified as a factory admin (or maybe we call it factory manager?), then they won’t be able to open the GUI, it’ll say “FACTORY > Owner has not added you as a factory manager! Access denied.” Then it pushes that player away like it would push away a non-faction member who was trying to raid a maintained factory.
